#  Simple S3 CDN Terraform Module

Creates DNS, SSL Certificate, S3 bucket, and a CloudFront distribution to enable an immutable store of static assets in a CDN configuration.

## DNS Information

This creates a DNS zone, hosted by Route53, using the specified domain name. It is up to the implementer to set the nameservers of the specified domain to the name servers generated by the Route53 DNS Zone which are output by this module

## Security Notes

The s3 bucket is configured to only allow access throught the CDN, but all assets can be read publicly, globally, without restriction.

The CDN distribution can only be accessed via SSL.

## Behavior Notes

The S3 origin does not function as a website. The intent is to host cacheable assets only.

The CDN distribution is intented to be immutable, so all assets are given a very long cache ttl of 1 year. Query string parameters, cookies, and headers are ignored and not forwarded.

By default, only US and Europe edge locations are selected for the CDN distribution. Change the price_class variable to "PriceClass_All" to enable global edge distribution
